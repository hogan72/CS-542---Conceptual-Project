1.  The general problem area of interest to me
    I’ve spent the majority of my career working on relational databases, specifically Oracle, so I’m interested in expanding my knowledge into the NoSQL area.  I’m curious to see how a NoSQL database stacks up to the reliability of a relational database design. 
    I will be creating a DynamoDB database to that will track NFL Football team statistics and I will attempt to predict game results based on the data.

2.  I’ll be using the following resources to assist with this project:
    Sullivan, D. (2015). NoSQL for Mere Mortals. Addison-Wesley Professional.
